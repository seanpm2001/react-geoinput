> Redux-form compatible geolocation suggestions and coordinates with Google Maps API.

<img src="demo.gif" alt="react-geoinput example" />

## Features

* Suggestion of locations with Google Maps API
* Address geocoding with Google Maps API
* Customizable debounced input
* Customizable suggestion serialization and rendering
* Customizable geo destination serialization and rendering
* Standard `input` interface (compatible with `redux-form`)

## Install

1. add `react-geoinput` as dependency
```
npm install --save react-geoinput
```

2. include Google Maps API

Make `window.google.maps` available e.g. with:

```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places&key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"></script>
```

link: [Google Maps JavaScript API
 / get API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

## Try demos locally

```
$ git clone https://github.com/woltapp/react-geoinput.git
$ cd react-geoinput
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

* `1_quickstart` demonstrates the use of `DefaultGeoInput`
* `2_barebones` uses only `createGeoInput` and demonstrates how to use the API to create your own input

## What problem does the library solve?

React-geoinput makes it a breeze to combine both __geolocation suggestion__
and __geocoding an address__. Generally other libraries do only either at once. A good use case for this library is to be able to turn an address into coordinates and verify that the interpreted address was correct in textual format. Moreover, this library allows complete customization of the UI, and only provides components to get you quickly started!

## Examples

### Quick start

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { createGeoInput, DefaultGeoInput } from 'react-geoinput';

const SimpleInput = createGeoInput(DefaultGeoInput);

class Example extends Component {
  state = {
    address: '',
    geoDestination: '',
  }

  onAddressChange = value => this.setState({ address: value })
  onGeoDestinationChange = value => this.setState({ geoDestination: value })

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <SimpleInput
          addressInput={{
            onChange: this.onAddressChange,
            value: this.state.address,
          }}
          geoDestinationInput={{
            onChange: this.onGeoDestinationChange,
            value: this.state.geoDestination,
          }}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Usage with Redux-form

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Fields } from 'redux-form';
import { createGeoInput, DefaultGeoInput } from 'react-geoinput';

const GeoInput = createGeoInput(DefaultGeoInput);

const GeoField = fields => (
  <GeoInput
    addressInput={fields.address.input}
    geoDestinationInput={fields.destination.input}
  />
);
```

Use with `redux-form`'s `Fields` component:

```jsx
<Fields names={['address', 'destination']} component={GeoField} />
```

## API Documentation

### Overview

React-geoinput exposes one higher order component (`createGeoInput`) and three regular
stateless React components (`DefaultGeoInput`, `GeoAddressInput`, `PredictiveInput`).

`createGeoInput` contains the main logic to handle fetching location
suggestions from the Google Maps API and to geocode the typed
address to a location object, which includes e.g. coordinates and parsed
location fields. In fact, `createGeoInput` provides __two__ inputs simultaneously:
typed address and geocoded location. Generally you'll want to store the information
separately, since address is the arbitrary string typed by user and location
is the accurate exact geolocation.

`DefaultGeoInput` exists to get you quickly started with the library. It contains
opinionated styles and structure, which is a good starting point. If it works
for you, you can customize it via the props, otherwise you can use
it simply as a starting point to create your own completely custom input component.
`DefaultGeoInput` uses `GeoAddressInput` underneath to provide the bare-bones
input with predictions (=suggestions).

`GeoAddressInput` is provided as a convenience component, which simply maps
the predictions (suggestions) from `createGeoInput()` to `PredictiveInput`.

`PredictiveInput` is provided as a utility component to provide a simple
input field with predictions -- it is not coupled to geocoding or locations anyhow.
It should be applicable for most cases and supports styling via props.
`PredictiveInput` uses `DebounceInput` from `react-debounce-input` to reduce
the amount of requests made to the Google Maps API.

### `createGeoInput(input: Component, <options: Object>)`

`createGeoInput` is a higher order component that takes two arguments, first of which is your custom input (or `DefaultGeoInput`),
and the second one is options object. It can be wrapped with a custom input component, such as with the provided `DefaultGeoInput`. The beef of this library's logic is in this HoC; thus you are encouraged to make a custom implementation of the input.

##### The following options can be set:

* __`serializePrediction`__ _(Function)_: A function that takes `prediction` object
from the Google Maps API as an argument and turns it into a string that is suggested.
The structure of the `prediction` object is not included in this documentation.

* __`serializeGeoDestination`__ _(Function)_: A function that takes `geoDestination` object
from the Google Maps API as an argument and turns it to another object. By default it maps
the `geoDestination` keys as following: `route->street`, `street_number->streetNumber`,
`subpremise->subpremise`, `locality->city`, `country->country`, `postal_code->postalCode`,
`{ geometry }->{ lat, lng},viewport`. The structure of the `geoDestination` object is not
included in this documentation.

> _Note: you won't need to change these options unless you know you are missing
an important value from the Google Maps API._


### `DefaultGeoInput`

`DefaultGeoInput` displays an input for typing the address. Predictions (=suggestions) will
be shown for the address with `PredictiveInput`. On predicted address selection the `geoDestionation`
will be also rendered.

> _Note: a good way to get started with your completely custom input is to copy the implementation of
`DefaultGeoInput` and modify it._

#### Props

* `activeIndex (number)`: control the selected index of location suggestion
* `addressInput (object.isRequired)`: input controls, such as `onChange`, `value`
* `className (string)`
* `geoDestinationInput (object.isRequired)`: input controls, such as `onChange`, `value`
* `geoDestinationClassName (string)`
* `geoDestinationTableClassName (string)`
* `loadingElement (node)`: element to display while loading geo destination
* `loadingGeoDestination (bool)`: control when to show `loadingElement`
* `onPredictionClick (func.isRequired)`: handle suggestion click, takes prediction `index`
* `predictions (array.isRequired)`: array of predictions from Google Maps API
* `style (object)`

### `GeoAddressInput`

#### Props

* `activeIndex (number)`: control the selected index of location suggestion
* `className (string)`
* `onPredictionClick (func.isRequired)`: handles prediction click, takes prediction `index`
* `onChange (func.isRequired)`: handle for address input change
* `predictions (array.isRequired)`: array of predictions from Google Maps API
* `style (object)`


### `PredictiveInput`

#### Props

* `className (string)`
* `containerClassName (string)`:
* `containerStyle (object)`:
* `debounceTimeout (number)`: time for debounce in ms
* `activePredictionId (string|number)`: control active prediction
* `predictions (arrayOf(predictionPropType))`: array of predictions (see below)
* `predictionsClassName (string)`
* `predictionItemClassName (string)`

```js
predictionPropType = PropTypes.shape({
  id: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number]),
  label: PropTypes.node,
  onClick: PropTypes.func,
})
```
